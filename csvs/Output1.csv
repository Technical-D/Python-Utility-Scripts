"Marie Curie (1867–1934) revolutionized the fields of physics and chemistry, becoming the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.

It is often speculated that Curie's remarkable scientific aptitude may have been influenced by her family. Her parents, Bronisława and Władysław Skłodowski, were both educators and instilled a love for learning in their children. While there is no direct evidence of extraordinary intellectual abilities in her parents, their commitment to education likely played a role in Marie's early development.

Marie Curie had two daughters with her husband Pierre Curie: Irène and Ève. Both Irène and Ève went on to make significant contributions to science and humanitarian causes.",PERSON,AWARD,first woman to win,Marie Curie,Nobel Prize
