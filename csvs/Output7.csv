"Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) is hailed as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, known for co-founding the Cubist movement and his innovative approach to art.

Picasso's family background was marked by artistic inclinations. His father, José Ruiz y Blasco, was an artist and art professor, and his mother, María Picasso y López, came from a family of artisans. While there is no direct evidence of extraordinary artistic abilities in his parents, their influence likely contributed to Pablo's early artistic pursuits.

Pablo Picasso had four children with three different partners: Paulo, Maya, Claude, and Paloma. Some of his children went on to have careers in the arts, including painting, photography, and writing.",PERSON,ORGANIZATION,co-founded,Pablo Picasso,the Cubist movement
